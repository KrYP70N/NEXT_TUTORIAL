## Installation

You can install with following command by running under your working directory.

> To prevent creating a new folder under the working directory, add a `.` in the command. In this case, to separate sample code from my lesson notes, I'll create a new folder called code. You can find related sample code for each lesson under this folder.

```
npx create-next-app@latest .
